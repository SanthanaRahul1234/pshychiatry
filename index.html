    <h4>A Quick Overview</h4>
    <p>A Psychiatrist uses talk therapy to treat people for emotional problems and mental illnesses.
        Depending on what degree and specialty they get, psychotherapists can be psychiatrists, psychologists,
        counselors, or social workers. They can work with individuals, couples, groups, or families.</p>
    <p>Psychiatrists use talk therapy to help you manage with general emotional unrest or acute trauma
        or illness. They treat everything from daily overwhelm to grief to specific mental disorders like
        depression or anxiety. Sometimes talk therapy is used in combination with medications or lifestyle
        changes. However, not all Psychiatrist are licensed to prescribe medication.</p>
